# Climate-Dashboard

## Description 

Ive created a custom climate dashboard. This app displays the current weaather and upcoming weather forecast. Based off of the users input, the dash board displays the corresponding weather data pulled from two weather API's. The user is presented  with the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, cloud coverage, the temperature, humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. Along with the displayed UV index is a color coded system that shows severity. On the bottom of the dashboard the user is also presented with a 5 day forecast for the selected city. Forecast displays the upcoming dates, weather icons, temperatures, and the humidity of each day. When the user clicks a city from the search history list then the current and upcoming weather data is updated to the selected city. Upon refreshing the the page all cities that have been searched persist in history list. The page displays the last known searched city as a default. User must enter first city to display data.
